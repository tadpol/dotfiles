# My Dotfiles

## todo

These below cross out of just dotfiles and are into package/extension management.  And very
much are things I want to manage, but should they get managed by the dotfile tool? or does
this belong to something else?

- VSCode extentions?
- Brewfile?
- lua rocks?
- npm global packages?
